1.Upload the entire `Reach Us Contact Form` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or search in the wordpress plugin directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.After installation add shortcode `[reach_us]` on your page to display the form.
By default form submissions will be send to your site's admin email address (set in Settings > General). It's also possible to send a confirmation email to sender.

== SMTP ==
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an internet standard for sending emails.
WordPress supports the PHP `mail()` function by default, but when using SMTP there's less chance your form submissions are being marked as spam.
You should install an additional plugin for this. You could install for example:

* [Gmail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gmail-smtp/)
* [Easy WP SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-wp-smtp/)
* [WP mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/)
* [Post SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/)
